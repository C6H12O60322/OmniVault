- Ran the FastAPI server; port 8000 was in use, used 8001 then stopped it.
- Installed Git (via winget) and configured repo with a separate `.gitstore/`.
- Initialized Git repo, added remote, created initial commit, pushed to GitHub.
- Added `.gitignore` to exclude `.venv/` and `.gitstore/`.
- Created `AGENTS.md`, `Context.MD`, and `README.md`.
